# MMM-ActivityBoard

WORK IN PROGRESS!

This will be the module I use to run the the ActivityBoard Vue app inside my MagicMirror.
Most of the hard lifting UI work is done by Vue, but the module will forward all the socket notifications from the node helper to the vue instance.
This way we can use the node helper while running a vue app in the electron browser.
